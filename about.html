<h2>History</h2>

<p>Founded on November 13, 1983 by twenty-seven female engineering students at Marquette University, Alpha Omega Epsilon became a recognized organization on the Marquette University campus, making it the oldest engineering sorority in the United States. The sorority gained its first international chapter, the Eta Chapter, on February 21, 1988. Alpha Omega Epsilon currently has thirty active chapters and three colonies.</p>

<h5>Beta Epsilon</h5>

<p>The University of Pennsylvania colony of Alpha Omega Epsilon was founded on May 1, 2011 by eight female engineering students. The colony was granted chapter status by the end of 2011, and became the Beta Epsilon chapter on January 28, 2012. The Beta Epsilon chapter consists of sisters who are engineering and technical sciences students from a variety of fields, who come from unique backgrounds and have diverse interests, and who share the common goals of friendship, leadership, and professionalism.</p>
